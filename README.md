# JHU - Exploratory Data Analysis, Assignment #2

## About
This repo contains R scripts to generate plots asked in the [assignment #2 of eda course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/b5Ecl/course-project-2)

## Dataset
The dataset for this exercice available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)

## Questions
1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in US from 1999 to 2008?
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City?
3. Which of 4 types of sources emission have decreased for Baltimore City?  
_(must use the ggplot2 plotting system)_
4. Across US, how emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed?
5. How emissions from motor vehicle sources changed in Baltimore?
6. Compare motor vehicle emisions in Baltimore City and Los Angeles County

## Notes:  
* one R script per question (6 in total)
* some scripts use libraries as ggplot2 and dplyr but wont install them (IMHO, a script should not)
* scripts start by downloading and unzip dataset each time (to always get last version in case it changes)
